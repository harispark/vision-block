# VISION Block
Vision Block is a software that I co-developped with a team of 3 people.

The main goal of this software is to help new students and professionnal to design and test very quickly image processing.

Thanks to its ergonomic UI, you can do many operations like binarisation, select a plan (R,V,B) etc. in order to see if you're implemeting the correct solution. No need to waste time coding solutions that takes long to implement !

It helps students to learn image processing thanks to the visual interface.

The application is compatible with windows and need .NET framework. It is built with WPF and C#.
